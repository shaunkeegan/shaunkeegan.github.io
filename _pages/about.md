I'm a Research Fellow at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, where I study the epidemiology of infectious diseases using statistical and mathematical modelling. My work focuses on understanding how pathogens spread, with the goal of informing public health interventions — particularly in the context of vaccine development and antimicrobial resistance. I have a strong interest in statistical epidemiology, mathematical models of infectious disease, and the dynamics of coinfection.

# Research Interests

🧫 **Seroepidemiology of *Klebsiella pneumoniae***

I'm currently working on a project funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to improve our understanding of *Klebsiella pneumoniae*, a major cause of neonatal sepsis globally. My focus is on mapping the seroepidemiology of this pathogen — identifying where and in whom it circulates — to support the development of effective vaccines. I also provide statistical support to the project’s seroepidemiology app and am developing resources to help other researchers adopt Bayesian methods for prevalence estimation.

### 🐄 Antimicrobial Resistance in African Animal Trypanosomiasis (AAT)

At the University of Glasgow, I worked on mathematical models exploring the spread of antimicrobial resistance in *Trypanosoma congolense*, which causes African Animal Trypanosomiasis in cattle. I built deterministic models (ODEs) to simulate how different treatment strategies — both therapeutic and prophylactic — influence resistance dynamics across Tanzanian farms. This work remains close to my interests in agricultural disease systems and policy-relevant modelling, and is still ongoing.

### 🌍 Coinfection Dynamics & Spatial Ecology

I’m also interested in how parasites interact within hosts and how these interactions influence transmission across landscapes. I used spatially structured models to study how heterogeneity in distributions of infected hosts affected the spread of co-infecting pathogens. This work has led me to investigate both competitive and facilitative interactions among parasites, and how they shape infection risk at the individual and population level. This work was primarily carried out during my PhD at the University of Liverpool, however some further publications will be released in due course.
