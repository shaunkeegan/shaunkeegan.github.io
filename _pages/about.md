I'm a Research Fellow at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, where I work on the epidemiology of infectious diseases using statistical and mathematical modelling. My work focuses on understanding how pathogens spread, with the goal of informing public health interventions — particularly in the context of vaccine development and antimicrobial resistance. I have a strong interest in statistical epidemiology, mathematical models of infectious disease, and the dynamics of coinfection.

# Research Interests

### Seroepidemiology of *Klebsiella pneumoniae*

I'm currently working on a project funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to improve our understanding of *Klebsiella pneumoniae*, a major cause of neonatal sepsis globally. My focus is on mapping the seroepidemiology of this pathogen — identifying where and in whom it circulates — to support the development of effective vaccines. I also provide statistical support to the project’s seroepidemiology app and am developing resources to help other researchers adopt Bayesian methods for prevalence estimation.

### Antimicrobial Resistance in African Animal Trypanosomiasis (AAT)

At the University of Glasgow, I worked on mathematical models exploring the spread of antimicrobial resistance in *Trypanosoma congolense*, which causes African Animal Trypanosomiasis in cattle. I built deterministic models (ODEs) to simulate how different treatment strategies — both therapeutic and prophylactic — influence resistance dynamics across Tanzanian farms. This work remains close to my interests in agricultural disease systems and policy-relevant modelling, and is still ongoing.
